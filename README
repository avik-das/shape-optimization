~~ ABOUT ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~ HOW TO BUILD ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ensure that all external dependencies have been satisified. Then, the following
command will build the application on *nix:

  make

TODO Windows build steps

~~ HOW TO RUN ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

./coaster <track-file-name>

~~ EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following libraries are used, along with the package that provides them on
Ubuntu (and possibly other Debian-based systems, including Debian itself).

* Eigen 2 (libeigen2-dev)
  - http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page
* Libbost Math 1.40 (libboost-math1.40-dev)
  - http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_40_0/libs/math/doc/html/index.html
* libpng 1.2 (libpng12-dev)
* OpenGL + GLUT (freeglut3-dev)

The following libraries are also used, but required more involved setup:

* AntTweakBar
  - http://www.antisphere.com/Wiki/tools:anttweakbar
  - This has been tested by building the library as a static library (see
    general technique at http://www.alecjacobson.com/weblog/?p=1370), and
    storing libAntTweakBar.a in ./lib/. It should work if the library is
    installed system-wide as a dynamically loaded library.
