[[The following is not a good thing: the "test step size" for finite differencing
and the step size to be taken in the energy landscape should be kept separate.
Also don't confuse a change in energy with the "gradient" which is delta e / delta p ! ]]
%The gradient is then normalized so its magnitude is the
step size, $\Delta p$, and this change is applied to the parameters
to produce the result of the current iteration.

%While a planar circle with a twist of $360^{\circ}$ demonstrated
the limitations of our system, the same shape with a slight perturbation
of one of the control points off the plane in which the other points
lie is indeed correctly optimized, albeit in an undesirable manner.
The perturbation effectively signals to the optimization that some
form of folding out of the plane should occur, but the optimization
proceeds locally before producing the desired planar, untwisted figure
eight. This result is summarized in Figure 7.

KBM has up vector in XZ plane.

Symmetric.

Keep C3-C6 as normal optimizable control points. Make tilt, etc. as different parameters. Make stretch of q0-q2 as parameters, as well as q7-q9. Add radius of each point as parameters.
