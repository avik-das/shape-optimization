title: Create new energy function that captures actual curvatures
desc: |-
  The current energy function captures bending energy more generally than we want
  just yet (though we want the general case later). Create an additional energy
  function that looks at the normal to the surface at a point, and how far the
  struts bend away from the tangential plane at the point.
