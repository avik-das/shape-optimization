title: Make iteration step size adaptive
desc: |-
  The step size used to vary the parameters of the geometry during the simulation
  should become increasingly smaller in order to pinpoint the actual minimum
  energy configuration. Clearly, some lower bound must be set, but the basic
  idea of apapting the step size needs to be implemented.
